%% SUMMARY OF FEATURES:
%%
%% All environments, commands, and options provided by the `ut-thesis'
%% class will be described below, at the point where they should appear
%% in the document.  See the file `ut-thesis.cls' for more details.
%%
%% To explicitly set the pagestyle of any blank page inserted with
%% \cleardoublepage, use one of \clearemptydoublepage,
%% \clearplaindoublepage, \clearthesisdoublepage, or
%% \clearstandarddoublepage (to use the style currently in effect).
%%
%% For single-spaced quotes or quotations, use the `longquote' and
%% `longquotation' environments.


%%%%%%%%%%%%         PREAMBLE         %%%%%%%%%%%%

%%  - Default settings format a final copy (single-sided, normal
%%    margins, one-and-a-half-spaced with single-spaced notes).
%%  - For a rough copy (double-sided, normal margins, double-spaced,
%%    with the word "DRAFT" printed at each corner of every page), use
%%    the `draft' option.
%%  - The default global line spacing can be changed with one of the
%%    options `singlespaced', `onehalfspaced', or `doublespaced'.
%%  - Footnotes and marginal notes are all single-spaced by default, but
%%    can be made to have the same spacing as the rest of the document
%%    by using the option `standardspacednotes'.
%%  - The size of the margins can be changed with one of the options:
%%     . `narrowmargins' (1 1/4" left, 3/4" others),
%%     . `normalmargins' (1 1/4" left, 1" others),
%%     . `widemargins' (1 1/4" all),
%%     . `extrawidemargins' (1 1/2" all).
%%  - The pagestyle of "cleared" pages (empty pages inserted in
%%    two-sided documents to put the next page on the right-hand side)
%%    can be set with one of the options `cleardoublepagestyleempty',
%%    `cleardoublepagestyleplain', or `cleardoublepagestylestandard'.
%%  - Any other standard option for the `report' document class can be
%%    used to override the default or draft settings (such as `10pt',
%%    `11pt', `12pt'), and standard LaTeX packages can be used to
%%    further customize the layout and/or formatting of the document.

%% *** Add any desired options. ***
\documentclass{ut-thesis}[10pt]


%% *** Add \usepackage declarations here. ***
%% The standard packages `geometry' and `setspace' are already loaded by
%% `ut-thesis' -- see their documentation for details of the features
%% they provide.  In particular, you may use the \geometry command here
%% to adjust the margins if none of the ut-thesis options are suitable
%% (see the `geometry' package for details).  You may also use the
%% \setstretch command to set the line spacing to a value other than
%% single, one-and-a-half, or double spaced (see the `setspace' package
%% for details).

%%%%%%%%%%%%      MAIN  DOCUMENT      %%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{document}

%% This sets the page style and numbering for preliminary sections.
\begin{preliminary}

%% This generates the title page from the information given above.
\maketitle

%% There should be NOTHING between the title page and abstract.
%% However, if your document is two-sided and you want the abstract
%% _not_ to appear on the back of the title page, then uncomment the
%% following line.
\cleardoublepage

%% This generates the abstract page, with the line spacing adjusted
%% according to SGS guidelines.
\begin{abstract}
%% *** Put your Abstract here. ***

	A monopolist wishes to maximize her profits by finding an optimal price menu. After she announces a menu of products and prices, each agent will choose to buy that product which maximizes his utility, if positive. 
	The principal's profits are the sum of the net earnings produced by each product sold.  
	These are determined by the costs of production and the distribution of products sold, which in turn are based on the distribution of anonymous agents and
	the choices they make in response to the principal's price menu. \medskip 
	
	In this thesis, two existence results will be provided, assuming each agent's disutility is a strictly increasing but not necessarily affine (i.e.,\ quasilinear) function of the price paid. This has been an open problem for several decades before the first multi-dimensional result obtained here and independently by N\"oldeke and Samuelson in 2015.\medskip
	

	Additionally, a necessary and sufficient condition for the convexity or concavity of this principal's (bilevel) optimization problem is investigated. 
	Concavity when present, makes the problem more amenable to 
	computational and theoretical analysis;  it is key to obtaining uniqueness and stability results for the principal's strategy in particular.  Even in the quasilinear case, our analysis goes beyond previous work by addressing convexity as well as concavity,  by establishing conditions which are not only sufficient but necessary,  and by requiring fewer hypotheses on the agents' preferences.	Moreover, the analytic and geometric interpretations of a specific condition relevant to the concavity of the problem have been explored.\medskip
	
	Finally, various examples are given to explain the interaction between preferences of agents' utility and monopolist's profit which ensure   statements equivalent to the concavity of the principal-agent problem. In particular, an example with quasilinear preferences on $n$-dimensional hyperbolic spaces is given with explicit solutions to show uniqueness without concavity. Similar results on spherical and Euclidean spaces are also provided. Additionally, the solutions of hyperbolic and spherical cases converge to those of Euclidean spaces as curvature goes to 0.\medskip
	%by showing (in exact form) the unique solutions of special examples with quasilinear preferences where domains are symmetric disks on $n$-dimensional hyperbolic,  spherical, or Euclidean spaces. What is more, the solutions of hyperbolic and spherical converges to that of Euclidean space as curvature goes to 0.
	
%	 Oriented by Loeper's work, %\cite{Loeper09}, 
%	my second solo work proves uniqueness by showing (in exact form) the unique solutions of special examples with quasilinear preferences where domains are symmetric disks on $n$-dimensional hyperbolic,  spherical, or Euclidean spaces. What is more, the solutions of hyperbolic and spherical converges to that of Euclidean space as curvature goes to 0.

\end{abstract}
\cleardoublepage
%% Anything placed between the abstract and table of contents will
%% appear on a separate page since the abstract ends with \newpage and
%% the table of contents starts with \clearpage.  Use \cleardoublepage
%% for anything that you want to appear on a right-hand page.

%% This generates a "dedication" section, if needed -- just a paragraph
%% formatted flush right (uncomment to have it appear in the document).
\begin{dedication}
	To my parents 
\\	Shuying Yu and Muli Zhang\\
	and my sister \\
	Qiuyu Zhang
%% *** Put your Dedication here. ***
\end{dedication}

%% The `dedication' and `acknowledgements' sections do not create new
%% pages so if you want the two sections to appear on separate pages,
%% uncomment the following line.
\newpage  % separate pages for dedication and acknowledgements

%% Alternatively, if you leave both on the same page, it is probably a
%% good idea to add a bit of extra vertical space in between the two --
%% for example, as follows (adjust as desired).
%\vspace{.5in}  % vertical space between dedication and acknowledgements

%% This generates an "acknowledgements" section, if needed
%% (uncomment to have it appear in the document).

%% *** Put your Acknowledgements here. ***

First and foremost, I would like to express my most profound gratitude to my advisor, Robert J. McCann, for his generous support of inspiration, encouragement, guidance, time, and patience, as well as financial support during my graduate study. Robert led me to the principal-agent problem and kept encouraging me on the research and writing processes. Our meetings and discussions on this topic have been the primary source of the ideas in this dissertation, most of which come from joint work with him.\medskip

I would like to thank my committee members, Xianwen Shi, for his guidance and encouragement in writing economics papers and fruitful discussions in economics topics, as well as his financial support during the summer of 2016, and Almut Burchard, for her encouragement and massive support in the early stage of my graduate career.\medskip

One of the most enjoyable periods of my graduate study must be the summer and fall semester spent at MSRI, Berkeley, in 2013. I would like to thank Robert for making it happen. In MSRI, I met a lot of renowned researchers in Optimal Transport and PDEs, %including %Cedric Villani, Luigi Ambrosio, Yann Brenier, Wilfrid Gangbo, Felix Otto, Alessio Figalli, and 
most notably Neil Trudinger, whose talk ``On the local theory of prescribed Jacobian equations" inspired our work on the generalization of nonlinear pricing problems.    \medskip

I also benefited much from the Fall 2014 program of the Fields Institute for the Mathematical Sciences. During this program, I met Guillaume Carlier, whose work influenced me. I would like to thank Guillaume for stimulating conversations. I would also like to thank Alfred Galichon and Robert McCann for inviting me to the NYU Workshop on Optimal Transportation, Equilibrium, and Applications to Economics, in April 2016. I would like to thank Alfred for his generous support, encouragement, and discussions.\medskip

I am grateful to Ivar Ekeland for stimulating conversations, Georg N\" oldeke and Larry Samuelson for sharing vital remarks.
I also got much help from the Optimal transport community, including  Afiny Akdemir, Jean-David Benamou, Yann Brenier, Shibing Chen, Marco Cuturi, Alessio Figalli, Nassif Ghoussoub, Nestor Guillen, Young-Heon Kim, Jun Kitagawa, Rosemonde Lareau-Dussault, Justin Martel, Evan Miller, Brendan Pass, Gabriel Peyré, Filippo Santambrogio and Cédric Villani. I much appreciate help from professors and researchers at the University of Toronto and other institutions, including John Bland, Guan Bo, James Colliander, Alfonso Gracia-Saz, Roger~Grosse, Marco Gualtieri, Robert Haslhofer, Ulrich Horst, Robert L. Jerrard, Jonathan Korman, Adrian Nachman, Mary Pugh, Joe Repka, Luis Seco,  Israel Michael Sigal, Adam Stinchcombe, and Catherine Sulem.
I would like to thank some graduate/undergraduate students and postdocs at the University of Toronto, from whom I got numerous encouragements, including Xinliang An,  Francis Bischoff, Li Chen, the late Yuri Cher,  Andrew Colinet, Payman Eskandari, Adam Gardner, Aidan Gomez, Mary He,  Jia Ji, Tomas Kojar, Chia-Cheng Liu, Xiao Liu,  James Lucas, Kevin Luk,  Amber Ma,  Mykola Matviichuk,  Xin Shen,  Kaixuan Wang,  Ming Xiao, Bin Xu,   Cheng Yang,  Qingwan Yin, Yuanyuan Zheng, and Zhifei Zhu.\medskip
 


I would also like to thank the administrative staff at the math department, in particular, the late Ida Bulat, Jemima Merisca, Patrina Seepersaud, and Sonja Injac, for all their endless help on making the graduate study more smooth and less stressful.  \medskip

Last but not the least, I would like to thank my parents and sister for their unconditional love, encouragement, and financial support.\medskip
